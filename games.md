List here the games you'll bring with you and would like to play.

## Werewolves

I (@djouuuuh) can organize a session of *The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow* (*Les loups-garous de Thiercelieux* in french) if we are at least **8** motivated players (+ the game master), else it won't be funny. The session may take place on **Saturday evening** because it's the only day I'm there.

I have the game edition called "The Pact" with all the existing expansions (New Moon, Characters and The Village). That means that if you're already familiar with this game, we could play in a very interesting way. Otherwise, we will stick at the basic game, that is funny too ;-)

#### Description

The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is "lynched", reveals her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.

#### Rules

I found this [document](http://www.boardgamer.ro/custom_images/regulamente/Regulament%20The%20Werewolves%20of%20Millers%20Hollow%20-%20New%20Moon.pdf) explaining the basic rules but we will explain it again and more deeply before the session.

#### Players

Could you please write down your name and your game level if you are interested so I could plan the session if we are enough to play? Thanks in advance!
