# RubyCamp BE 2015

[RubyCamp](http://rubycamp.brug.be/) is an unformal and community based. You
[want to give a workshop or a talk? Do it. You want to build a project with
[others? Do it. This is also a good time for uncoding activities (like sports!)
[and for knowing each other better. It comes from the original
[RailsCamp](http://railscamps.com/).

As a participant, you have access to this repository. It is your place to
prepare, plan, organize your activities, projects, etc. Please make it yours.
The weekend depends on it.

Do not forget to [join our slack](http://rubyburgers.herokuapp.com/) to discuss
the event.
